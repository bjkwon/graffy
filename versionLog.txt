2.11 SetRange bug fixed

2.12 Bug fix: 1) When stereo sounds are plotted, xlim[1] was reset in each call to CAxis::plot, causing the xlim to be determined by the second channel (R-channel), instead of max (L-chan, R-chan). 2) for x64, function address for OpenFigure in graffy64.dll was not set correctly, so no plot calls in Auxtra.cpp were working.

2.13 bug fix: 
1) z-order problem in Windows 7 (create IDD_PLOT as child to the desktop for Win7 only).
2) bufBlockSize omitted in CSignal::RMS() --causing error in Truncate()
3) get(fig,"pos") did not work
